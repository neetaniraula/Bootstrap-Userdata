# Bootstrap-Userdata

This repository contains user data scripts designed for bootstrapping virtual machines or instances in cloud environments (e.g., AWS EC2). These scripts automate the process of configuring and initializing instances at launch, ensuring they are ready for use with the necessary software and tools.

## What is Bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping is the process of automating the initialization and configuration of a virtual machine or instance as it launches. It involves setting up the system environment, installing software, and configuring services, allowing the instance to be production-ready immediately upon startup.

## What is User Data?

In cloud environments like AWS, **user data** is a mechanism to pass scripts or commands to an instance during launch. The instance executes these user data scripts at its first boot. These scripts are typically used for bootstrapping the instance by automating tasks such as software installations, environment configuration, or service initialization.

## Files in this Repository

- **jenkins.sh** – This script is used to install and configure the following tools on a newly launched instance:
  - Java Development Kit (JDK)
  - Jenkins
  - Docker
  - Trivy (container security scanner)
  - kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool)

- **sonar.sh** – This script installs Docker and runs a SonarQube container for static code analysis. It ensures that the instance is ready to host and run SonarQube in a containerized environment.

- **nexus.sh** – This script installs Docker and runs a Nexus Repository Manager container. Nexus is used to manage and store build artifacts, and this script automates the setup of the Nexus environment in a Docker container.

## Usage

1. Copy the relevant user data script from this repository.
2. During instance launch (e.g., AWS EC2), paste the script into the "User Data" field in the instance configuration panel.
3. The instance will execute the user data script on the first boot, installing and configuring the software according to the instructions in the script.

### Example Usage with AWS EC2:

- For Jenkins setup, use `jenkins.sh` in the User Data section to install and configure Jenkins, Docker, Trivy, kubectl, and JDK automatically.
- For SonarQube setup, use `sonar.sh` to automatically install Docker and run SonarQube in a container.
- For Nexus setup, use `nexus.sh` to automatically install Docker and run Nexus Repository Manager in a container.

### Customization:

Feel free to adjust or customize the scripts to fit your specific environment and requirements.
